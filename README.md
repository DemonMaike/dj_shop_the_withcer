Hi There! This is my first full website, here i want to work with all steps of site development  - a planning of development, template creating, site development, tests creating and documentation creating.
My planning of stack is Django, Docker and Compose, django.test, draw.io, Notion, Github, Bootstrap.

Here i want to up my skills for testing and documentation writing my code, and also working with API.

Steps:

1. The choise a methodology of development.

This poject have a clear requirements, but a functional can change.
Because of this my choice was based on iteration model of develpoment.

2. Modeling of project.

This step created on draw.io. It includes create a templates of pages and shame of database.

3. Creating the project.

This step includes:

a) the create the project on django;
b) the create .env for save secret info;
c) the change the setting.py on tasks;
d) the create urls;
e) the create simple templates, views and tests of availability pages;
f) the create the form for registarion and authorization, create tests;
g) the create models and put data, create tests, change tepmplates under requirements;
h) apply style to pages using Bootstrap;

On everyone steps i doing changes urls, tests, tamplates and add an info here.


Also into this project i created —Åustom control command for auto-copeleted data in database, and this is new for me.

That project has urlpatterns with regular expressions(in main url.py for cart app).
